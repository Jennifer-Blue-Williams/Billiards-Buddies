Billiards Buddies

## About Billiards Buddies

This app was created for myself and my friends that I play pool with. The Billiards Buddies app allows users to log in and record the results of a game against any other player so they can track their personal wins/losses. This will give the user an idea of where they stand ability-wise amongst their peers and provide a way to meet other players through friends. 

### How is Billiards Buddies Useful?

In addition to being able to keep a record of your own wins and losses against friends, the user can view all results of any other registered users games as well. This will aid in determining if another player is more skilled, less skilled, or about the same caliber as you.
